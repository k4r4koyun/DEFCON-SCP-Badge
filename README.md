# DEFCON-SCP-Badge
Repository for the SCP badge I've designed for DEFCON 30. I did not upload the actual KiCAD files since at it's current state, the design is flawed. I've originally added AA batteries but later realized they drop voltage too quickly to be used effectively. Even if I swap AA batteries for something like 18600 LiPo ones, I would need to re-route the power from batteries to go through the LDO so that they won't fry other stuff.

Also misplaced/misrouted the caps for the neopixels :(
